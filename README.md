# Project Overview

This repository presents the research artifacts of my undergraduate thesis investigating whether **MSRCR-based illumination preprocessing** can improve the **stability and discriminability** of deep-feature keyframe selection in **Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR)** systems.

The proposed method, **EnMSRCR (Enhanced Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration)**, extends the traditional MSRCR algorithm by introducing adaptive parameters based on image brightness and contrast characteristics.

The research combines **computer vision**, **image enhancement**, **deep learning**, and **statistical inference** to evaluate how illumination preprocessing influences downstream feature extraction and retrieval performance.

# Key Findings

| Result | Value |
|---|---|
| Clustering stability SD reduction (Standard MSRCR, normal lighting) | **40.8% improvement** (0.0669 → 0.0396) |
| Low-light Precision@5 recovery (Standard MSRCR, *f* = 0.4) | **0.960 → 0.980** |
| Bilateral Filter component effect | **Cohen's d = −0.741**, *p* < .001 |
| Adaptive parameter components | Statistically equivalent to Standard MSRCR (*p* > .79) |

## Main Insight

**MSRCR-based preprocessing significantly improves the reproducibility of clustering-based keyframe selection across independent runs without sacrificing retrieval accuracy.**

The six-variant ablation study further demonstrates that:

- Adaptive parameter tuning provides a safe and backward-compatible extension of Standard MSRCR.
- Bilateral-filter-based illumination estimation improves visual appearance but negatively affects downstream ResNet-18 feature discriminability.

# Pipeline Architecture

The proposed framework integrates illumination enhancement before deep feature extraction.

**Frame Extraction → Illumination Enhancement → ResNet-18 Feature Extraction → K-means Clustering → Similarity Retrieval**

# EnMSRCR Algorithm

Traditional MSRCR applies fixed parameters:

- α = 125
- β = 46
- σ ∈ {15, 80, 250}

These parameters cannot adapt to different illumination conditions.

EnMSRCR introduces adaptive parameter estimation using image brightness (μ_b) and contrast (σ_c).

## Adaptive Components

### 1. Adaptive α and β

Adjusts color restoration strength according to image illumination.

### 2. Bilateral Filter Illumination Estimation

Replaces Gaussian filtering while preserving edge information.

### 3. Adaptive Multi-scale σ

Automatically adjusts illumination estimation scales based on image characteristics.

# Six-Variant Ablation Study

A six-variant ablation study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of each adaptive component.

| ID | Variant | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baseline | Lower retrieval performance under low-light conditions |
| 2 | Standard MSRCR | Reference method |
| 3 | Adaptive α, β | Statistically equivalent (*p* = .844) |
| 4 | Bilateral Filter | **Significantly worse** (*d* = −0.741, *p* < .001) |
| 5 | Adaptive σ | Statistically equivalent (*p* = .796) |
| 6 | Full EnMSRCR | Performance influenced by Bilateral Filter limitations |

### Interpretation

The adaptive parameter components are safe extensions of Standard MSRCR.

However, Bilateral Filter-based illumination estimation suppresses texture information that ResNet-18 relies on for feature discrimination, illustrating that improved visual quality does not necessarily lead to improved retrieval performance.
